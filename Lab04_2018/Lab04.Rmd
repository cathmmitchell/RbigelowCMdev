*Other possible subsection: Line graphs for different stations (instead of bar charts)??*

# 4 Categorical data (t-tests, bar charts, box plots, other stats?)

## 4.1 t-tests
*a bit of a contrived example...*

1.	use discrete data and determine the mean chl conc for each station and depth
2.	use t-test to answer: is the surface chl conc different at station 1 compared to station 2

## 4.2 Bar charts

Bar charts for categorical data e.g. three different treatments and the photosynthetic rate at each treatment

## 4.3 Box plots
Box plots for categorical data where you have multiple measurements at each treatment so can do a mean, stdev, etc.
